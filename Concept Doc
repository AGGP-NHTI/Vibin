Team 'Vibin' Game Concept:

For our game, we decided on a multi-themed, level based, hack n' slash platformer.
The layout would have a srt of carnival, or theme park feel, with each level having a
different theme (eg. medieval, sci-fi, zombie, etc.). Each level ending in a boss fight
that fits the theme.

(Feel free to elaborate everone.)
